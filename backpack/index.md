## about

**backpack** is a tool for helping users understand the identity information they're
presenting (and leaking) all over the internet. It provides understandable
traffic introspection through readable reports and helpful alerts.

According to [Pew Research](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/11/12/most-would-like-to-do-more-to-protect-their-personal-information-online/), users are struggling to get a handle on what and how
they can keep private. We all are.  We don't have a good grip on what identities
we're carrying with us when we go from server to server, cloud to cloud, CDN to
CDN. Between single sign-on, supercookies, writing analysis, deep packet
inspection, and metadata tracking, it's hard to understand how identities are
created, assigned, and tracked through the internet.

**backpack** aims to change this.

We're in (functioning) alpha right now, so check us out on [github](https://github.com/teampizza/backpack) and stay tuned
for more.
